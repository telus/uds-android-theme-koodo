## Installation

JitPack is a novel package repository for JVM and Android projects. It builds Git projects on demand and provides you with ready-to-use artifacts (jar, aar).

If you want your library to be available to the world, there is no need to go through project build and upload steps. All you need to do is push your project to GitHub and JitPack will take care of the rest. That’s really it!

In case your project is already on GitHub, JitPack makes sure it can be built by anyone. Want to use a GitHub library in your project? Follow the simple steps explained in the ‘Building with JitPack’ section.

For issues and enhancements, please use the JitPack GitHub repository. The repository contains this documentation and contributions are welcome there as well.

If you’d like some help with setting up repositories please use the Support button on the web site.
